    <!--HTML Links
    
        Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their
        way from page to page.
    -->

    <!--HTML Links - Hyperlinks
    
        HTML links are hyperlinks.

        You can click on a link and jump to another document.

        When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

        Note: A link does not have to be text. link can be an image or any other HTML element!
    -->

    <!--HTML Links - Syntax
    
        <a href="url>">link text<a/>

        The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute,
        which indicates the link's destination.

        The link text is the ppart that will be visible to the reader.

        Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.
    -->

    <h1>HTML Links</h1>

    <p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Visit Google.com!</a></p>

    <hr>

    <!--by default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
    
        . An unvisited link is underlined and blue
        . A wisited link is underlined and purple
        . An active linkis underlined and red

        Tip: links can of course be styled with CSS, to get another look !
    -->

    <!--HTML Links - The target Attribute
    
        By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window.
        To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

        The target attribute specifes where to open the linked document.

        The target attribute can have one of the following values:

        . _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it
        was clicked
        . _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
        ._parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
        ._top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
    -->

    <h2>The target Attribute</h2>

    <a href="https://google.com/" target="_blank">Visit Google!</a>

    <p>If target="_blank", the link will open in a new browsers window or tab.</p>

    <!--Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
    
        A local link (a link to page within the same website) is specified with a
        relative URL (without the "https://www" part):
    -->

    <h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>
